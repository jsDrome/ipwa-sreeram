# Why I chose a life in Germany over a well paid job in India and the UK

What do I really need in life? Happiness? Money? Greatness?

I believe everything translates to this: **Life -> happiness -> love -> value -> money -> time**.

We know that we need to live. We know that we want to be happy. We want others to be happy. And we do that by sharing love. But to this consitently over time, you need a good social life, a good society. And to make use of it, you need to create value.

So what is money? Its equal to the value you have created in the world. You need to create value to get value and money is the one and only way of quantifying it. The more the value you create, the more the money you get, and the more the value you can draw from the society. And for that, you need to decide how you want to live your life.

So at the age of 30 while I am still single, I decided to put my time time on life experiences and knowledge. Thats why I decided to travel for work.

When I wrote this answer in Quora, I received an amazing response by a lot of people. It drew a lot of flak too. So here goes an insight into the decisions I made. It was not easy. There are a lot of good arguments on either sides. Like why be confined to one country because today Indian, tomorrow earthling? Who decides on the borders? Why move away from parents? Why are you adding to brain drain? My mind asks me all sorts of these questions.

Questions like these are very difficult to be given a straight answer. There are pros and cons, two sides, like a coin, like a double edged sword. The answer depends on what you want in what stage of your life. So will touch upon a few decisions I made.

By late 2019, 3 pathways opened up in front of me:

 - To continue living in the UK until 2022 and return.
 - To move back to India for a big pay cheque.
 - To move to Germany with a better pay than the UK, and with PR.

All of the 3 had their pros and cons and I had to choose 1 based on these main factors:

## Monthly savings
Being in India would have fetched me the most money. But the money in the EU was no less to lead a comfortable life. I decided money shouldnt be a deciding factor at 30. So there were no clear favourites here. ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³-1, ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª-1, ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§-1

## Family
All my relatives are in India except some distant relatives. When you have enough money, you will realise its of no value without the most important people in your life around you especially when they are ageing. So India won hands down here. ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³-2, ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª-1, ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§-1

## Quality of life
The beareucracy, health care, education, safety in the EU seemed better than India's. At the time of writing this, India still had some way to go. ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³-2, ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª-2, ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§-2

## Service to the nation
I can serve my country better at home. The plan for the future is to create my own company and generate jobs. Right now, I am teaching people, sometimes for free in my free time. ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³-3, ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª-2, ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§-2

## Scalability
Better in EU. Especially in DE as opposed to UK, because I had the choice of more than 1 country. ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³-3, ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª-3, ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§-2

## Language
IN holds an edge over the UK. In Germany, I needed to learn German. Although it is an added advantage to know another language, it seemed a bit of an overhead. ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³-4, ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª-3, ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§-3

## Permanent residency
With the Blue card you get the freedom to move around the EU. This is added advantage. I have this by default in India. I didnt get this in the UK because of the ICT visa I was in and 6 years of life and hard work there would have been only to move out of the country. ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³-5, ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª-4, ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§-3

## Experience of the world
Now this is an important point, probably the most important point I considered. So the goal of my life became: How would I use my time effectively to make the most value and use it to bring happiness to me and my loved ones around me? To take money out of the equation, one had to have a lot of it. One had to grow it. I believed investing in experience, knowledge and wisdom rather than lottery, fixed deposits and mutual funds. So the best thing to do seemed to work hard at a young age, sacrifise a few things while being still young, make a lot of money, knowledge and connections and then make money work for me. Also, the experience I'd gain from meeting new people, learning a new language, living alone, facing issues myself, paying multiple taxes, flying business class, missing flights, negotiating rents etc - you just cant get these being in your cocoon. Obviously you wont need this if you get that kind of money in the world. But let me ask you this, would you rather have all the money in the world and sleep in your home all the time?
ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³-5, ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª-5, ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§-3

## Verdict
Theoretically speaking, going to Germany or the UK is the best bet in the long term if it comes with the PR.

But without the PR, India beats Germany like Germany beat Brazil in the 2014 WC because personally, my feelings about parents, friends, marriage, country etc along with a 40 LPA salary and a chance to be part of something revolutionary outweighs a lonely life in Germany or the UK. So I think I will stick to ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³

But only after I am done exploring the world and learning everything life has to offer. Also, because I'm young, single, have the time to take risks in my life, and because I had spent considerable amount of time in the UK and would still not get a PR, and the fact the income gap is wide, and for the experience factor, I went for ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª

And, the amount of experience I'd gain from moving to Germany at an early stage in my life outweighed a comfortable life in India at that stage because you cant put a price tag on life's lessons. If I had been 35, maybe I'd have chosen to stay back. I'm not and I have 5 years to go to experience life and the world before settling down.

Will I be back in India? Thats the aim.
