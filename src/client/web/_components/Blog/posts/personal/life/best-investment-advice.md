# My take on Investing

&nbsp;

Let me begin by explaining stating a fact.

Money is relative. So is being rich. Just because you have lot of money, doesnt make you rich. Having more money than others makes you rich.

Now, let me through out two terms: Acceleration and Banks.

Acceleration is when you run faster than your current speed. In terms of money, you accelerate when you are worth more than the previous day.

Now let’s take a running race as an example with 10 people. If everybody accelerate equally, who gets to the end first? Nobody.

Now lets look at Banks. Banks are just brokers. They take the money from people without ideas, and give it to the people who have ideas who accelerate its growth. Stock markets, Gold schemes and Mutual funds are just a manifestation of this.

Now let’s imagine a fictitious society of 10 people. If everybody invest in the same usual things to make money grow, who is the richest in the end? Nobody.

Do you see where I am getting at?

The point is, there is no value in following the crows. Stocks, Gold, FDs and MFs - everybody do it these days. Sure they help your money grow. But these are of diminishing returns. These are normal stuff people do. Nothing out of the ordinary.

So what can you do that makes you make more money than the others? For the investment that has the most returns is doing what others don’t do and with consistency. And thats investing in yourself with an appetite to take risks and learning from its failures.

Reading regularly, being healthy, having a great personality, being a better person than the day before, getting another degree, thinking for yourself etc are some things you can do to invest in yourself. Try to create a company, travel the world, discuss and debate, learn from others, etc are somethings you can use your money to gain knowledge.

The very job you got using your college degree is a proof of that. Daily investment for 4 years in knowledge in a college.

There are things normal people in their normal life. The people who make money grow linearly fall in the middle class. The people who make money grow exponentially become rich. And knowing this is the secret sauce of rich people.


Good luck.
