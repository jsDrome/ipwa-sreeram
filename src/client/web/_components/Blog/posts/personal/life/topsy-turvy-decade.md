# The topsy-truvy of a decade I had

&nbsp;

Amazing how I had just been thinking about this today and here was this question in quora. So I had to answer it. Just like most people in the lower middle class in India, I had my fair share of sheer struggle to get to the top. Here goes my rags to riches story.

**From back bencher to dropping out of college to Engineer**: In 2009, I hated Computer Science. All I could think of was playing cricket in a ground. From a school which laid emphasis on Physics, Mathematics, English etc, I saw Computer science as an outsider. Something like a co-curricular activity like the stitching classes. I struggled for a degree in college. Around the 6th semester, I was at the brink of dropping out. Teachers and friends wrote me off. I still remember my friends joking that I will never pass out. I remember my professor saying I will never clear her paper. On an average, I wrote almost every one of the 52 papers in the engineering degree twice. Those days still haunt me. I think it was around 2011 that I really matured as an adult and realised I had been taking my life for granted. I decided to be my own coach and I cleared 18 exams to pass out among my peers. Fast forward to 2020: I am a Senior Software Engineer. I work with some of the best engineers. How? That's a story for another time.

**From rural India to London**: In 2009, I was in a rural town in India. I never saw myself as an achiever. I was just the regular average guy. 2020: My job takes me places. I moved to Trivandrum to Kochi to Chennai to Bangalore to London and I am in Berlin now. I have also travelled 13 countries solo. And I know it wont stop here.

**From road-side eateries to Michelin-star restaurants:** There was a time when I was eating food from the road side eateries 2 times a day. There were a few occasions when I fell sick too. Today, I cook my own food and I occasionally eat food from some of the greatest restaurants in the world. My favourite is Cirrik in Dalston, London. I used to visit it every week with my girlfriend at the time.

**From freelancer to founder**: In 2009, I was working for myself. I didn’t know what startups were. I was just working for random people for small wages. Entrepreneur was a word I couldn't even pronounce. I then worked for a startup, Wipro, Nokia, Apple, Lloyds Bank and Delivery Hero. I then set up my own organisation.

**Failure-fearing to failure-embracing**: Things didn’t come to me the easy way. Most things I learnt have been through a string of failure be it in my personal life of professional. Life is not about being in the comfort zone. Its to do well outside your comfort zone.

**Homeless to penthouse** (not exactly a penthouse, but didn't get a better word to make it sound dramatic): In 2009, I lived with my parents. I remember the days when I used to have fights and would run away from my home for some hours. 2020: I now live in my own apartment in a nice area in Berlin. If you happen to be in Friedrichshain, let's meet up.

**Zero to 1C**: In 2009, I had 0 money. I am on course to save my croreth rupee next year.

**Learner to teacher**: In 2009, I learnt from others. Today mentor 50 people back home for free each month.

And finally, this is me over 2009–2019.

It’s not to say that I have succeeded in every aspect of life. I do have some way to go in my personal life but I think I have reached a reasonably good place in terms of my career, thanks to the topsy-turvy of a life in the last decade. But the coach in me is happy and proud. And, If you wish for a life like mine, don’t do. Wish for a life you will be content with. And thats what matters!

I will end it by quoting an excerpt from my favourite poem:

    I shall be telling this with a sigh
    Somewhere ages and ages hence:
    Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
    I took the one less traveled by,
    And that has made all the difference.

Thank you for reading.
