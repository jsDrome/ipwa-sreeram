# The best solo trip I made

&nbsp;

Seen above is the view from the top of Aurthur's seat in Edinburgh, Scotland. Taken in April 2017, this was my 4th trip solo to a capital city. As part of the 4 day holiday, I walked to Hollyrood park which is a few miles away from the city centre. From there, its about a half an hour's climb to the top of the mountain. On a sunny day, which luckily was the case that day, you are treated to this view. You feel like you are on top of the world. Especially when there is no one around but you with the cool breeze hitting you like you've achieved something like the calmness after the storm. That was one of the most satisfying trip I ever did.

I spent a lot of time here, took a nap, read a book, had a mini lunch and continued my journey. Oh and by the way, behind me, was this.
