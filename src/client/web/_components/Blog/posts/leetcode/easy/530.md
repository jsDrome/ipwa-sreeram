# 530. Minimum Absolute Difference in BST

#### 13 July 2020 by Sreeram Padmanabhan

Given a binary search tree with non-negative values, find the minimum absolute difference between values of any two nodes.

    var getMinimumDifference = function(root) {
      let res = [];

      const traverse = (node = root) => {
        node.left && traverse(node.left);
        res.push(node.val);
        node.right && traverse(node.right);
      };

      traverse();

      let diff;

      for (let i = 1; i < res.length; i++) {
        if (!diff) diff = res[i] - res[i-1];
        else if (res[i] - res[i-1] < diff) diff = res[i] - res[i-1];
      }

      return diff;
    };
