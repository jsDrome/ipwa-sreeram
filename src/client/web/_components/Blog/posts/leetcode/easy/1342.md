# 1342. Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero

#### 11 July 2020 by Sreeram Padmanabhan

Given a non-negative integer num, return the number of steps to reduce it to zero. If the current number is even, you have to divide it by 2, otherwise, you have to subtract 1 from it.

var numberOfSteps  = function(num) {
  if (!num) return 0;
  let count = 0;

  while (num > 0) {
    if (isOdd(num)) num--;
    else num /= 2;
    count++;
  }

  return count;
};

const isOdd = n => n % 2 === 1;
