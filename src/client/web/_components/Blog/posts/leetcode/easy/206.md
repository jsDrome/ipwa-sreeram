# 206. Reverse Linked List

#### 14 July 2020 by Sreeram Padmanabhan

Reverse a singly linked list.

const reverse = head => {
  if (!head) return null;

  let pointer = head;
  let prev = null;

  while (pointer) {
    const next = pointer.next;
    pointer.next = prev;
    prev = pointer;
    pointer = next;
  }

  return prev;
}

### Time complexity: O(n)
### Space complexity: O(1)
