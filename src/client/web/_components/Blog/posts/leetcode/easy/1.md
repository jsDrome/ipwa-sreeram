# 1. Two Sum

#### 12 July 2020 by Sreeram Padmanabhan

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

    const twoSum = (arr, target) => {
      const map = {};

      for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        const curr = arr[i];
        const comp = target - curr;
        if (comp in map) return [i, map[comp]];
        map[curr] = i;
      }

      return [];
    }
