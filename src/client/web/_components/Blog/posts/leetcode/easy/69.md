# 69. Sqrt(x)

#### 12 July 2020 by Sreeram Padmanabhan

Implement int sqrt(int x).

Compute and return the square root of x, where x is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.

    /**
    * @param {number} x
    * @return {number}
    */
    var mySqrt = function(x) {
        let i = 1;

        while (i * i <= x) {
          i++;
        }

        return i - 1;
    };
