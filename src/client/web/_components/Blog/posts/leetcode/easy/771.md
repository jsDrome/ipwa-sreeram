# 771. Jewels and Stones

#### 11 July 2020 by Sreeram Padmanabhan

You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

    var numJewelsInStones = function(J, S) {
        const map = {};
        for (let i = 0; i < J.length; i++) {
            map[J[i]] = 1;
        }
        let count = 0;

        for (let i = 0; i < S.length; i++) {
            if (map[S[i]]) count++;
        }
        return count;
    };

### Time complexity: O(n)
### Space complexity: O(1)
