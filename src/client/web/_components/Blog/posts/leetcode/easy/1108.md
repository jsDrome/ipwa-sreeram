# 1108. Defanging an IP Address

#### 11 July 2020 by Sreeram Padmanabhan

Given a valid (IPv4) IP address, return a defanged version of that IP address.

A defanged IP address replaces every period "." with "[.]".

    var defangIPaddr = function(address) {
        let pointer = 0;
        let ret = '';

        while (address[pointer]) {
            if (address[pointer] === '.') ret += '[.]';
            else ret += address[pointer];
            pointer++;
        }
        return ret;
    };
