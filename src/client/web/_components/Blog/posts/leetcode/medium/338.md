# 338. Counting Bits

#### 14 July 2020 by Sreeram Padmanabhan

Given a non negative integer number num. For every numbers i in the range 0 ≤ i ≤ num calculate the number of 1's in their binary representation and return them as an array.

    var countBits = n => {
      let res = [0];
      for (let i = 1; i <=n; i++) {
        const half = Math.floor(i/2);
        res[i] = i % 2 === 0 ? res[half] : res[half] + 1;
      }
      return res;
    }

### Time complexity: O(n)
### Space complexity: O(1)


### Alternate method

    var countBits = n => {
      let res = [0];
      for (let i = 1; i <=n; i++) res[i] = res[i & i-1] + 1;
      return res;
    }
