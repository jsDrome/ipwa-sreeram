**Hallo leute!** I am Sreeram Padmanabhan. Friends call me Siri or Sree. I am a Web Engineer and this is my personal website, Web of Thoughts. I am the founder of jsDrome. I also created and run the [Z Axis Challenge](https://zaxis.jsdrome.com). I am also a trainer and a photographer. I travel regularly and have so far covered 13 countries and several cities. I will be covering a lot more over the next years. Currently, I live in Berlin, Germany and I am a Lead Engineer at Delivery Hero.

## What this site is about

This is my personal website / technical blog. I write about things I find interesting, the places I visited, the people I met, the photos I took, the food I cooked, the cuisines I tried, the friends I made, the decisions I took, the company I created and many other things. This is also the place I put my knowledge of the web to test. I belive that if even one gets inspired, its a victory.
